## Background Context
`Fix my code` is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometime you will know the language, sometime not.

Please download the repository [0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just fix it!

## status_server/
I just started a new Flask project and the first thing I’m putting in place is a route for the status of my API (super important for a load balancer implementation).

But I don’t know why it’s not working…

Could you look at it and fix it please?

My code is [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/tree/master/status_server/)

## square.py
Look [my square](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/square.py), it’s perfect? No? Should I change something?

## 
I’m running into a serious problem!

I just start my OOP project and nothing works…

Could you help me please? My code is [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/user.py)
